The solution involves carefully checking the types of all props passed to the component. You can utilize TypeScript for static type checking, or add runtime type validation using libraries like PropTypes.  Ensure consistency in data types across the application.  For `useState` and `useReducer` issues, review your state update logic to make sure the updates are correctly typed. Thoroughly examine your component's prop types and the data being passed into it, ensuring the expected types align. Example solutions include adding prop type validation, converting data types before passing them, using TypeScript, and carefully reviewing state update logic.
