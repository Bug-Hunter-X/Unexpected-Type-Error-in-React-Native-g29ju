This error occurs when using a third-party library that expects a specific format for its props, but the props passed from the parent component do not match that format. For example, if a component expects a prop of type `number` but receives a prop of type `string`, this error may occur.  Another common cause is inconsistencies in the data type between different parts of the React Native application (e.g., passing a `number` where a `string` is expected). Incorrect usage of the `useState` or `useReducer` hooks can also lead to unexpected data types and related errors.
